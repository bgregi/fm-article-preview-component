## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- SASS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

The challenge served as a great introduction to my Javascript projects, because I was able to remember many concepts I'd seen in my classes but had never really applied before. 

The CSS part was fairly simple, thanks to the minimalistic design, but I still had some troubles at first with the image positioning and sizing. Once I learned about the object-fit property, things started to go well. I also applied for the first time the :after pseudo-property and learned some of what it is capable of.

As I mentioned, Javascript was the most interesting part for me, which is where I learned to change objects classes and colors and make elements appear and disappear on the screen.

Overall, it was a great challenge and I'm excited for the next one.
